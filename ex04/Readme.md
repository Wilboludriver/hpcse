# Exercise 4

## Goals

* Implementing diffusion equation
* Implementindg PSE method
* Introduction to OpenMP

## Grading

You can grade the exercise by using the `grade.py` grading script (Python).
You determine your point score by grading the exercise yourself, detailed
point distributions are provided with the exercise solutions.  You then create
your grade file by calling the `grade.py` script (example where with 2
questions to be graded):

```bash
python grade.py \
    --question1 17 \
    --comment1 'I justify my point score because of this and that' \
    -q2 14 \
    -c2 'Part c did not converge'
```

Explanation:

* Pass your point score for the question `X` using the `--questionX` argument.
  Alternatively, you can use the short form `-qX`.  The arguments accepts an
  _integer_ value.  The default value if omitted is `0`.
* **Optional**: You can decorate question `X` with comments by using the
  `--commentX` or `-cX` argument.  You may use this argument multiple times to
  pass more than one comment if you like.  The argument accepts a _string_, be
  sure to quote them correctly.
* Use `python grade.py --help` for help.

For your convenience, we provide a `make_grade.sh` BASH script where you can
fill in your point scores and save the file for your later reference.  The
exercise grades are determined with a tight linear scale.  Zero points is a
grade 3.0, maximum points is a 6.0.

### Hand-in your grade

The script generates a `grade.txt` file for the exercise.  You hand-in your
grade by **submitting** this file on Moodle under the 'Grading' section.  You
can hand-in your grade any time before Nov 26 12:00, 2021.
